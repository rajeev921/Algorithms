/*
The trick here is that :
Bitwise-AND of any two numbers will always produce a number less than or equal to the smaller number.

Consider the following example:

									12 ---- 1100
									11 ---- 1011
									10 ---- 1010
									9  ---- 1001
									8  ---- 1000
									7  ---- 0111
									6  ---- 0110
									5  ---- 0101
Desired Range: [5,12]

Starting from 12, the loop will first do
12 & 11 = 8

Next iteration, the loop will do
8 & 7 = 0

why did we skip anding of 10,9? Because even if we did so, the result would eventually be anded with 8 whose value would be lesser than equal to 8.

Hence, you start from the range end and keep working your way down the range till you reach the start.
